About eclipse_GIT2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KANG01 is a new and very fast sample java source. It aims to be a lightweight source available
through all major platforms. This project has been originally started only for educational purposes.
But from its start, KANG01 has grown into a feature-rich source.

KANG01 has all standard package you expect from a source. It includes bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar)
and tabs. Above that, it has by default enabled blocking ads with a built-in plugin.

Before you start compiling, make sure that you have installed the Qt (>= 5.6) development libraries
and you have read the [BUILDING](https://github.com/QupZilla/qupzilla/blob/master/BUILDING) information.

**Linux**

 * OpenSSL (libcrypto) is required
 * xcb libraries when building without NO_X11

**Windows**
 * OpenSSL (libeay32) is required

Then you can start compiling by running this commands:

    $ qmake
    $ make

After a successful compilation the executable binary can be found in the bin/ directory.
On Fedora and possibly other Linux distributions you need to replace `qmake` with `qmake-qt5`.

On Linux/Unix: To install QupZilla, run this command: (it may be necessary to run it as root)

    $ make install

On Mac OS X: To deploy QupZilla in dmg image, run this command:

    $ ./mac/macdeploy.sh full-path-to-macdeployqt

You need to specify path to `macdeployqt` only if it is not in PATH.

About QupZilla
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QupZilla is a new and very fast QtWebEngine browser. It aims to be a lightweight web browser
available through all major platforms. This project has been originally started only
for educational purposes. But from its start, QupZilla has grown into a feature-rich browser.

QupZilla has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes bookmarks,
history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, it has by default enabled blocking ads
with a built-in AdBlock plugin.

History
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The very first version of QupZilla has been released in December 2010 and it was written
in Python with PyQt4 bindings. After a few versions, QupZilla has been completely rewritten
in C++ with the Qt Framework. The Windows version of QupZilla was compiled using MinGW, but due to
a huge problem with Flash, it is now compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2008.
First public release was 1.0.0-b4.

Until version 2.0, QupZilla was using QtWebKit. QtWebKit is now deprecated and new versions
are using QtWebEngine.
